## Usage Guide
First, when you go to our website there will be a welcome landing page that allows you to login with your Google account. This will set up your personal account for you to seamlessly access your information.

Once you have logged in, you will see the user dashboard. This page will show all your current workout logs and provide you with navigation to the numerous functionalities offered by the app.

If you select a workout type from the main dashboard, you will be brought to another page where you can then select your specific workout and input the quantity of workout completed. This will then be added to your personal experience system where experience is gained to level up.

Finally, the social aspect of our app allows users to compare their point with their friends on their own personal friends leaderboard. Not only that but the database of users are all stored on the leaderboard page where you can check out the top users and see how many points they have.

Hopefully this app motivates you to workout more and try and climb the leaderboard!
